# Project Offboarding

When a project concludes or your engagement ends, follow these steps for a smooth offboarding process.

## Offboarding Checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit all pending work">
    Complete and submit any in-progress evaluations before your end date.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Log final hours">
    Ensure all time-tracked hours are accurately recorded and submitted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return project materials">
    Delete any locally stored project files, data, or credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revoke tool access">
    You will lose access to project-specific tools (Slack channels, shared drives, etc.) after offboarding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm final payout">
    Verify your payment details are current. Your final payout will be processed in the next payout cycle.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Offboarding from one project does not affect your Rubric AI account. You remain eligible for future tasks and opportunities.
</Note>

## Project Paused

Sometimes a project may be temporarily paused rather than ended. During a pause:

- You will not receive new tasks for that project
- Your contractor status and account remain active
- Submit any outstanding hours before the pause takes effect
- You may still be eligible for tasks on other projects

## After Offboarding

Once offboarding is complete:

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Platform access | Retained (for other projects) |
| Project-specific tools | Revoked |
| Pending payments | Processed in next cycle |
| Future opportunities | Still eligible |

You'll receive an email confirmation when offboarding is complete. If you have questions about your final payout or remaining work, contact your project lead or support.
