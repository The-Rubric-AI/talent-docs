# Project Onboarding

This guide walks you through each step of accepting an offer — from reviewing your contract to configuring payments and starting work.

## Onboarding Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Accessing Your Offer">
    New offers appear in your Home dashboard. Click View Offer to see the details including task type, compensation, and requirements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Offer Details">
    The offer page includes contract title, type, start date, onboarding document, compensation details, required documents, and checklist items to complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identity Verification">
    Click Start Verification from the onboarding checklist. Upload photos of your government-issued ID, record a selfie video for liveness verification, then submit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document Signing">
    Review and sign your Terms of Work with your full legal name, Confidentiality Agreement for IP terms, and Tax Form (W-9 for US, W-8BEN for non-US).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Setup">
    Complete the payment onboarding from your Profile page. Ensure your legal name matches across your profile, payment platform, and bank account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Background Check">
    Some projects require a background check. You'll receive an email invite from the verification provider. Complete the form within 48 hours. You must be cleared before logging any work hours.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Troubleshooting:** If an offer doesn't appear, try a hard refresh (Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + R), re-login, or use a different browser. Contact support if the issue persists.
</Warning>

## Identity Verification Details

The identity verification process includes:

1. **Government ID** — Upload clear photos of the front and back of your government-issued ID (passport, driver's license, or national ID)
2. **Liveness Check** — Record a short selfie video to verify you're a real person
3. **Confirmation** — A green checkmark confirms successful verification

<Note>
  Identity verification only needs to be completed once. It will apply to all future projects.
