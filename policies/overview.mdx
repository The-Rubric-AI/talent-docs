## Time Tracking & Pay

Accurate time tracking is essential for hourly projects:

- Do not log time for breaks, setup, or idle periods
- Review and confirm your daily time logs for accuracy
- Discrepancies in time tracking may be audited and adjusted

## Confidentiality & IP Protection

All project materials are confidential:

| Follow project-specific guidelines | Discuss project details publicly |
| Report security concerns | Store materials on personal cloud drives |

## Data & Privacy

Rubric AI processes personal data in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Evaluation data may contain protected health information (PHI) — handle it with the same care required under HIPAA and equivalent regulations.

**Never:**
- Store PHI on personal devices
- Share PHI outside the evaluation platform
- Access PHI for purposes other than assigned tasks
