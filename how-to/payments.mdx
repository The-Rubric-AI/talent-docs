## Payout Schedule

Payouts are processed on a bi-weekly cadence. After a task is marked as completed and approved:

- **First payout** may have a 7-day hold for verification
- **Subsequent payouts** are processed within 3–5 business days
- You can track all earnings and payout status on the **Earnings** page

## Tax Documentation

Depending on your country of residence, you may need to complete tax documentation:

| Location | Required Form |
|----------|---------------|
| United States | W-9 |
| Non-US | W-8BEN |

These forms will be presented during the payment setup process. Ensure all information matches your legal documents exactly.
