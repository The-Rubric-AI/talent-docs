Know a qualified professional who would be a great fit for Rubric AI? Refer them to the platform and earn a bonus when they complete their first task.

## How Referrals Work

1. **Share your referral link** — Find your unique referral link in the Earnings page
2. **They sign up** — Your referral creates an account using your link
3. **They complete onboarding** — They finish setting up their profile and credentials
