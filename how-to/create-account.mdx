  Rubric AI uses passwordless email verification. Enter your email address to register, and a verification email will be sent to you. You also have the option to continue using your Google account.

## Create your account

    Visit the Rubric AI portal. You will find fields for your email address, a Login button, a Sign Up option, and an option to Continue with Google.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your email">
    Enter your email address and select 'Sign Up'. A verification email will be sent to that address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify from your inbox">
    Open the verification email and follow the instructions to complete registration. If you don't see it, check your spam or junk folder, or try resending.
  </Step>

## Signing in

After your account is created, signing in works the same way:

1. Enter your email address
2. Click the verification link sent to your inbox
3. You'll be logged into your dashboard

<Note>
  Each person may only have one account. If you need to update your email, contact support rather than creating a new account.
</Note>

## Phone Verification

Phone verification is required when you receive a contract or task offer — not during initial signup. You will need a valid mobile phone number. VoIP numbers and landlines are not supported.
